*Flow visualisation of the hollow cube in wind tunnel*

**Description:**  
This project explored the flow and pollutant transport through a hollow cube model placed in a turbulent boundary layer to understand indoor-outdoor pollution coupling. Experiments were performed in the 20 m wind tunnel at the University of Southampton using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and tracer concentration measurements.

*Vortex ring interacting with a bubble in water tank*

**Description:**  
This study examined the dynamics of vortex rings interacting with air bubbles in quiescent water, focusing on vorticity dynamics and bubble deformation. Experiments used high-speed imaging and PIV techniques to analyse the interaction mechanisms.

*Bubble injection from top wall in turbulent channel flow*

**Description:**  
This project investigated the effect of salt concentration on top-wall bubble injection in a turbulent channel flow. The experiments measured bubble dynamics, slip velocities, and drag reduction using flow visualisation and wall shear stress measurements.
