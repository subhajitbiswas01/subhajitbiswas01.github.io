My doctoral research at IISc Bangalore focused on understanding **bubbly turbulent flows**, examining the complex interactions between air bubbles, buoyant rigid particles, and vortex structures, alongside applications in drag reduction. This work builds fundamental insights for marine, industrial, and environmental multiphase flows.
