##  **Flow through a hollow cube in a turbulent boundary layer: towards understanding indoor pollutant dispersion**

<div style="text-align: justify;">

Indoor air quality is critical for public health since people spend most of their time indoors, where the concentration of pollutants is usually higher than outdoors, and could be life-threatening in cases such as potential gas leaks. In such a scenario, cross ventilation could be crucial in minimizing indoor pollutant concentration through the indoor‚Äìoutdoor exchange of air. Despite many studies on indoor flow and dispersion, there is a noticeable gap in understanding indoor‚Äìoutdoor cross-ventilation coupled with indoor dispersion sources. To address this gap, we experimentally investigate the flow through a hollow cube, a scaled-down model building, as an idealized representation, with an indoor ground-level passive scalar source, immersed in a rough-wall turbulent boundary layer (see Fig. 1(a)) inside a water tunnel. The focus is on characterizing scalar transport within the cube through simultaneous measurements of scalar and flow using Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence and Particle Image Velocimetry, respectively, studied for different Reynolds numbers. The present study consists of three cube configurations, ‚Äúcenter‚Äù, ‚Äúup‚Äìdown‚Äù, and ‚Äúdown‚Äìup‚Äù, distinguished by window positions at the upstream and downstream ends of the cube. Substantial variations in the indoor flow patterns are observed across these configurations, resulting in larger differences in the advective and turbulent scalar fluxes, scalar concentration, and distribution (see Figs. 1(b,c,d)). The analysis is extended by revising the classical ‚ÄúBox-model‚Äù, by introducing practical complexities such as non-perfect mixing. The insights from this simplified study can potentially improve our understanding and help model pollutant exchange between indoor and outdoor environments in complex atmospheric boundary layer conditions.

##  **Indoor-outdoor passive scalar exchange in a flow through a hollow building with a ground level outdoor source**

<div style="text-align: justify;">

Understanding how turbulent processes disperse air pollution inside buildings is crucial for urban planning and occupancy comfort. Driven by this motivation, the present work investigates an idealization of the indoor‚Äìoutdoor exchange of a passive scalar pollutant in an urban environment, namely, flow-through an isolated hollow cube, a scaled-down (about 40:1) model building immersed in a turbulent boundary layer, with windows in the upstream and downstream faces of the cube.
Presently, two cases are investigated where the first one involves an indoor ground-level passive scalar source, and the second one has an outdoor ground-level source placed upstream to the model, with both being studied for a fixed Reynolds number ($Re = U_{\text{ref}} H / \nu$) of $\approx 20{,}000$; here $U_{\text{ref}}$ is the incoming flow velocity at the cube height ($H$) measured without the cube. The experiments take place in a recirculating water tunnel where Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) measurements are performed to capture the mean and transient behaviours of a scalar and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) to capture the velocity fields, with these two being performed simultaneously. Changing the source position significantly alters the scalar transport and distribution inside the model. The indoor injection case shows scalar accumulation in recirculation flow regions near the top and bottom walls inside the cube, while in the outdoor case, a relatively uniform scalar buildup within the cube is observed. These differences are found to be due to the distinction between the two cases in the advective and turbulent scalar transport mechanisms. The insights from the present results can significantly contribute to our understanding and modelling of pollutant(s) exchange between indoor and outdoor environments in intricate atmospheric boundary layer conditions.

## **Vortex Ring and Bubble Interaction: Effects of Bubble Size on Vorticity Dynamics and Bubble Dynamics**

<div style="text-align: justify;">

In most studies on bubble deformation and breakup in turbulence, the influence of bubble size is not considered independently, as it is usually accounted for through the Weber number ($We$). However, alongside $We$, bubble size can also be a critical parameter since it influences the bubble‚Äôs dynamical characteristics and its interaction with vortices.  I studied the interaction of a single vortex ring with a deforming air bubble, at different bubble-to-vortex ring size ratios ($\Phi$) over a wide range of $We$.  <strong>Bubble dynamics:</strong> Varying $\Phi$ brings striking changes in bubble deformation and breakup dynamics, even at a fixed $We$, during the initial stage. At later stages, the statistics are nearly independent of $\Phi$ and governed primarily by $We$.  <strong>Vortex ring dynamics:</strong> The evolution depends on both $\Phi$ and $We$. Reductions in the ring's propagation speed and enstrophy caused by the bubble follow a scaling of ${\Phi}^2/\sqrt{We}$. Above a critical $\Phi \approx 1.2$, significant ring deformation and fragmentation occur.

## **Interaction of a rigid buoyant sphere and a deforming bubble with a vortex ring: The role of deformability**

<div style="text-align: justify;">

In bubbly flows, the deformability of bubbles is critical in governing the dynamics of both the carrier and dispersed phase. To better understand this aspect, I studied the interaction between a rigid buoyant particle (a non-deforming bubble) and a vortex ring at a fixed $\Phi$, and compared it with bubble‚Äìring interactions.  Distinct differences emerge right from the capture phase. Unlike the bubble, which has a quicker capture time due to its large elongation and lower drag, the non-deforming particle takes longer to be captured due to higher drag. Post-capture, the rigid particle does not deform and remains localized within the ring, unlike the bubble which spreads azimuthally.  These differences lead to distinct effects on the ring‚Äôs dynamics: Rigid particle case ($We = 0$): The localized perturbation to the vorticity causes greater disruption of the vortex ring compared to the deforming bubble ($We > 0$).  I further varied the particle size and identified several regimes of particle motion within the vortex ring. The scalings for the modified ring characteristics are substantially different than in the bubble case, with a smaller critical particle size.

## **Interaction of a vortex ring with a buoyant spherical particle: effects of particle size on vorticity dynamics and particle dynamics**

<div style="text-align: justify;">

The present work experimentally investigates the interaction of a buoyant (rigid) spherical particle with a single translating (water) vortex ring, focusing on the effects of particle-to-vortex core size ratio ($D_p/D_{c,o}$) on both the particle dynamics and ring dynamics ($D_p =$ particle diameter, $D_{c,o} =$ vortex core diameter). These interactions are studied for $D_p/D_{c,o} = 0.6‚Äì1.7$, over ring Reynolds numbers ($Re = \Gamma / \nu; \Gamma =$ ring circulation) of $6000‚Äì67{,}300$.
As the buoyant particle comes close to the ring, it gets captured into the low-pressure vortex core, and the interaction begins. The particle within the core undergoes radial oscillation, spins and translates along the ring‚Äôs azimuthal axis. As $D_p/D_{c,o}$ increases, the particle undergoes higher-amplitude radial oscillation and a relatively shorter azimuthal translation. The differences in the particle size and its motion within the ring lead to large differences in the ring‚Äôs dynamics. A larger particle is seen to lead to a higher ring disruption, substantially reducing the ring‚Äôs convection speed and azimuthal enstrophy, which are seen to scale as $(D_p/D_{c,o})^{2.3} Re^{-0.37}$ and $(D_p/D_{c,o})^{1.3} Re^{-0.25}$, respectively. The ring disruption is significant above $D_p/D_{c,o} \approx 1.0$, beyond which the ring fragments, with up to 60% drop in convection speed and 90% drop in enstrophy, at low $Re$, as compared with the base ring. These results for the rigid particle size effects on the vortex ring dynamics are more dramatic than for a deforming bubble. Our results could help to better understand and model buoyant particle (and bubble) interactions with coherent structures in turbulence.

## **Effect of single and multiple bubbles on a thin vortex ring**

<div style="text-align: justify;">

This focuses on the interaction of multiple air bubbles (a swarm) with a single vortex ring formed in water. This builds upon the single-bubble study, adding the complexity of many bubbles. As the ring travels through the swarm, it continuously captures bubbles, resulting in a time-varying ratio of total bubble volume within the ring to the ring volume. This leads to more dramatic interactions, weakening the ring faster than in the single-bubble case.

## **Effects of salt concentration on top wall bubble injection in a turbulent channel flow: bubble dynamics and wall drag reduction**

<div style="text-align: justify;">

Many bubble drag reduction (BDR) applications occur in contaminated environments (e.g., seawater) where surface-active agents modify bubble coalescence and affect drag. However, most studies are performed in freshwater, which does not represent real conditions. I experimentally investigated the effects of salt concentration ($M$) on bubble dynamics and drag modification in a fully developed horizontal turbulent channel flow.  Increasing $M$ reduces bubble coalescence, producing smaller bubbles that change deformability, migration, and distribution. At low $Re$, the addition of salt dramatically reduces bubble sizes (to ~100 microns) compared to large coalesced bubbles (~cm) in no-salt cases.  This reduction in bubble size increases drag, which saturates beyond a critical $M_{critical}$. At higher $Re$, the effect of $M$ is smaller.

## **Fish-like propulsion: thrust generation using 2-D and 3-D flapping foils**

<div style="text-align: justify;">

Fish use flapping motions to generate thrust, with the oscillating tail as the primary propulsion mechanism. Studying these motions helps understand and mimic efficient thrust generation. I experimentally studied thrust from sinusoidal pitching motion of rigid, flexible, and hybrid foils of varying shapes in a uniform flow at different pitching amplitudes, $Re$, and flexibilities ($EI$). The transient shapes of the flexible foils were characterized using image processing and correlated with measured unsteady forces and moments from a load cell.
