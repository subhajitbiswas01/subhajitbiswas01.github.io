## ðŸŒ€ **Part I: Vortex Ring and Bubble Interaction â€” Indoor-Outdoor Flow**

<div style="text-align: justify;">

Over the past few decades, rapid urbanization has significantly degraded the air quality in both indoor and outdoor environments. Most studies focus on pollutant dispersion and transport mechanisms either in indoor or outdoor spaces, typically using configurations such as flows around scaled-down solid buildings or flows through hollow buildings under atmospheric boundary layer conditions. This work investigates a diverse parametric space, including the effects of:  Pollutant source location (indoor vs. outdoor), Flow Reynolds number ($Re$), Boundary layer to building height ratio ($\delta/H$). 

Cross ventilation plays a crucial role in dispersing indoor pollutants through the exchange of indoor and outdoor air. To understand the pollutant transport mechanisms in such scenarios, I experimentally investigate the flow through a hollow cube with an indoor pollutant source (Rhodamine dye, used as a passive scalar) immersed in an atmospheric boundary layer inside a water tunnel. I characterize the scalar transport mechanisms by measuring the advective and turbulent scalar fluxes using simultaneous scalar measurements (Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence, PLIF) and velocity measurements (Particle Image Velocimetry, PIV). Such a combined characterization has not been reported earlier in this flow configuration.  Furthermore, I report substantial effects of window opening positioning on the indoor flow structure and scalar concentration, distribution, and timescales. The results from the experiments are also used to construct an analytical model to help predict indoor pollutant concentration in such cross-ventilating flow configurations.

## ðŸŒ€ **How critical is bubble size in the interaction of a vortex with a bubble**

<div style="text-align: justify;">

In most studies on bubble deformation and breakup in turbulence, the influence of bubble size is not considered independently, as it is usually accounted for through the Weber number ($We$). However, alongside $We$, bubble size can also be a critical parameter since it influences the bubbleâ€™s dynamical characteristics and its interaction with vortices.  

I studied the interaction of a single vortex ring with a deforming air bubble, at different bubble-to-vortex ring size ratios ($\Phi$) over a wide range of $We$.  

- **Bubble dynamics:** Varying $\Phi$ brings striking changes in bubble deformation and breakup dynamics, even at a fixed $We$, during the initial stage. At later stages, the statistics are nearly independent of $\Phi$ and governed primarily by $We$.  
- **Vortex ring dynamics:** The evolution depends on both $\Phi$ and $We$. Reductions in the ring's propagation speed and enstrophy caused by the bubble follow a scaling of ${\Phi}^2/\sqrt{We}$. Above a critical $\Phi \approx 1.2$, significant ring deformation and fragmentation occur.

## ðŸŒ€ **Vortex-particle interaction: dramatic role of bubble's deformability**

<div style="text-align: justify;">

In bubbly flows, the deformability of bubbles is critical in governing the dynamics of both the carrier and dispersed phase. To better understand this aspect, I studied the interaction between a rigid buoyant particle (a non-deforming bubble) and a vortex ring at a fixed $\Phi$, and compared it with bubbleâ€“ring interactions.  

Distinct differences emerge right from the capture phase. Unlike the bubble, which has a quicker capture time due to its large elongation and lower drag, the non-deforming particle takes longer to be captured due to higher drag. Post-capture, the rigid particle does not deform and remains localized within the ring, unlike the bubble which spreads azimuthally.  

These differences lead to distinct effects on the ringâ€™s dynamics:  
- **Rigid particle case ($We = 0$):** The localized perturbation to the vorticity causes greater disruption of the vortex ring compared to the deforming bubble ($We > 0$).  
- I further varied the particle size and identified several regimes of particle motion within the vortex ring. The scalings for the modified ring characteristics are substantially different than in the bubble case, with a smaller critical particle size.

## ðŸŒ€ **A vortex propagating in a swarm of bubbles**

<div style="text-align: justify;">

I studied the interaction of multiple air bubbles (a swarm) with a single vortex ring formed in water. This builds upon the single-bubble study, adding the complexity of many bubbles.  

As the ring travels through the swarm, it continuously captures bubbles, resulting in a time-varying ratio of total bubble volume within the ring to the ring volume. This leads to more dramatic interactions, weakening the ring faster than in the single-bubble case.

## ðŸŒ€ **Friction drag modification in a turbulent flow using air bubbles: role of contamination concentration**

<div style="text-align: justify;">

Many bubble drag reduction (BDR) applications occur in contaminated environments (e.g., seawater) where surface-active agents modify bubble coalescence and affect drag. However, most studies are performed in freshwater, which does not represent real conditions.  

I experimentally investigated the effects of salt concentration ($M$) on bubble dynamics and drag modification in a fully developed horizontal turbulent channel flow.  

- **Findings:** Increasing $M$ reduces bubble coalescence, producing smaller bubbles that change deformability, migration, and distribution.  
- At low $Re$, addition of salt dramatically reduces bubble sizes (to ~100 microns) compared to large coalesced bubbles (~cm) in no-salt cases.  
- This reduction in bubble size increases drag, which saturates beyond a critical $M_{critical}$. At higher $Re$, the effect of $M$ is smaller.

## ðŸŒ€ **Fish-like propulsion: thrust generation using 2-D and 3-D flapping foils**

<div style="text-align: justify;">

Fish use flapping motions to generate thrust, with the oscillating tail as the primary propulsion mechanism. Studying these motions helps understand and mimic efficient thrust generation. I experimentally studied thrust from sinusoidal pitching motion of rigid, flexible, and hybrid foils of varying shapes in a uniform flow at different pitching amplitudes, $Re$, and flexibilities ($EI$). The transient shapes of the flexible foils were characterized using image processing and correlated with measured unsteady forces and moments from a load cell.
