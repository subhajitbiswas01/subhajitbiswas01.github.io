##  **Flow through a hollow cube in a turbulent boundary layer: towards understanding indoor pollutant dispersion**

<div style="text-align: justify;">

Over the past few decades, rapid urbanization has significantly degraded the air quality in both indoor and outdoor environments. Most studies focus on pollutant dispersion and transport mechanisms either in indoor or outdoor spaces, typically using scaled-down building models under controlled boundary layer conditions.

## **Cross-Ventilation and Scalar Transport Mechanisms**

<div style="text-align: justify;">

The experimental study investigates a hollow cube placed in a turbulent boundary layer within a water tunnel. A passive scalar (Rhodamine dye) is released from an indoor source, and its transport characteristics are analyzed under different inflow and geometric configurations. By combining simultaneous PLIF and PIV measurements, we quantify the scalar fluxes and identify dominant transport mechanisms.  

The findings reveal strong dependencies on window configurations and boundary layer thickness, with direct implications for predicting pollutant exposure in naturally ventilated buildings.
