**Flow through a hollow cube in a turbulent boundary layer: towards understanding indoor pollutant dispersion**

<div style="text-align: justify;">

Over the past few decades, rapid urbanization has significantly degraded the air quality in both indoor and outdoor environments. Most studies focus on pollutant dispersion and transport mechanisms either in indoor or outdoor spaces, typically using configurations such as flows around scaled-down solid buildings or flows through hollow buildings under atmospheric boundary layer conditions. This work investigates a diverse parametric space, including the effects of:  Pollutant source location (indoor vs. outdoor), Flow Reynolds number ($Re$), Boundary layer to building height ratio ($\delta/H$). 

Cross ventilation plays a crucial role in dispersing indoor pollutants through the exchange of indoor and outdoor air. To understand the pollutant transport mechanisms in such scenarios, I experimentally investigate the flow through a hollow cube with an indoor pollutant source (Rhodamine dye, used as a passive scalar) immersed in an atmospheric boundary layer inside a water tunnel. I characterize the scalar transport mechanisms by measuring the advective and turbulent scalar fluxes using simultaneous scalar measurements (Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence, PLIF) and velocity measurements (Particle Image Velocimetry, PIV). Such a combined characterization has not been reported earlier in this flow configuration.  Furthermore, I report substantial effects of window opening positioning on the indoor flow structure and scalar concentration, distribution, and timescales. The results from the experiments are also used to construct an analytical model to help predict indoor pollutant concentration in such cross-ventilating flow configurations.

## **Vortex Ring and Bubble Interaction: Effects of Bubble Size on Vorticity Dynamics and Bubble Dynamics**

<div style="text-align: justify;">

In most studies on bubble deformation and breakup in turbulence, the influence of bubble size is not considered independently, as it is usually accounted for through the Weber number ($We$). However, alongside $We$, bubble size can also be a critical parameter since it influences the bubbleâ€™s dynamical characteristics and its interaction with vortices.

I studied the interaction of a single vortex ring with a deforming air bubble, at different bubble-to-vortex ring size ratios ($\Phi$) over a wide range of $We$.  

<strong>Bubble dynamics:</strong> Varying $\Phi$ brings striking changes in bubble deformation and breakup dynamics, even at a fixed $We$, during the initial stage. At later stages, the statistics are nearly independent of $\Phi$ and governed primarily by $We$.  

<strong>Vortex ring dynamics:</strong> The evolution depends on both $\Phi$ and $We$. Reductions in the ring's propagation speed and enstrophy caused by the bubble follow a scaling of ${\Phi}^2/\sqrt{We}$. Above a critical $\Phi \approx 1.2$, significant ring deformation and fragmentation occur.
