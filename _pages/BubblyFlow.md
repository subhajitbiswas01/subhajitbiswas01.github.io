<div style="text-align: justify;">

Over the past few decades, rapid urbanization has significantly degraded the air quality in both indoor and outdoor environments. Most studies focus on pollutant dispersion and transport mechanisms either in indoor or outdoor spaces, typically using configurations such as flows around scaled-down solid building(s) or flow through hollow building(s) under atmospheric boundary layer conditions. This work investigates a diverse parametric space, including the effects of: Pollutant source location (indoor vs. outdoor), Flow Reynolds number ($Re$), Boundary layer to building height ratio ($\delta/H$).    

Cross ventilation plays a crucial role in dispersing indoor pollutants through the exchange of indoor and outdoor air. To understand the pollutant transport mechanisms in such scenarios, I experimentally investigate the flow through a hollow cube with an indoor pollutant source (Rhodamine dye, as a passive scalar) immersed in an atmospheric boundary layer inside a water tunnel.

<p style="margin-top:10px;">
<strong><u>Novelty:</u></strong> I characterize the scalar transport mechanisms by measuring the advective and turbulent scalar fluxes from simultaneous scalar measurements using Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) and velocity measurements using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). Such a combined characterization has not been reported earlier in this flow configuration. Further, I report substantial effects of window opening positioning (see Fig. 1bâ€“d) on indoor flow and scalar concentration, distribution, and time scales. The results from the experiments are further used to construct an analytical model to help predict indoor pollutant concentration in such cross-ventilating flow configurations.

## ðŸŒ€ **Interaction of bubble(s) and buoyant rigid particles with vortical structures: Towards understanding bubbly turbulent flows**

<div style="text-align: justify;">

<div style="text-align: justify;">

Bubble/particle-laden turbulent flows involve the complex interaction of many bubbles/particles with vortical structures (Fig. \ref{Bubbles_in_TBL}) having a range of length scales. \textit{\textbf{My work}} experimentally investigated an idealization of these flows, namely, the interaction of a vortex ring (in water) with air bubble(s) and rigid particles (Fig. \ref{Schematic_ring_bubble}). Following these, I further studied an application of bubbly flows, namely, drag reductions using air bubble injection into a (water) turbulent boundary layer in a channel flow.

## ðŸŒ€ **Vortex ring and bubble interaction: Effects of bubble size on vorticity dynamics and bubble dynamics**

<div style="text-align: justify;">

In most studies on bubble deformation and breakup in turbulence, the influence of bubble size is not considered independently, as it is usually accounted for through the Weber number ($We$). However, alongside $We$, bubble size can also be a critical parameter since it influences the bubbleâ€™s dynamical characteristics and its interaction with vortices. To investigate these two-way interactions, I studied the interaction of a single vortex ring with a deforming air bubble, at different bubble-to-vortex ring size ratios ($\Phi$) over a wide range of Weber numbers ($We =$ vortex strength / surface tension).  In a ringâ€“bubble interaction, the bubble is first captured by the low pressure within the core of the ring, then stretched azimuthally within the core, and gradually broken up into smaller bubbles. During the bubble elongation and breakup, the vorticity within the core of the ring is also modified due to the presence of the bubble(s).  On the <u>bubble dynamics side</u>, varying $\Phi$ brings striking changes in bubble deformation and breakup dynamics, even at a fixed $We$, during the initial stage of interaction. These behaviours are characterized by a range of scalings in the $We$â€“$\Phi$ plane. At later stages, however, the statistics become nearly independent of $\Phi$ and are governed primarily by $We$. On the <u>vortex ring dynamics side</u>, the evolution depends on both $\Phi$ and $We$. For instance, the reduction in the ring's propagation speed and enstrophy caused by the bubble (at later stages) follows a scaling of ${\Phi}^2/\sqrt{We}$. In addition, effects become more dramatic above a critical $\Phi \approx 1.2$, where significant ring deformation and fragmentation of the vortex core occur (see Fig. 2).
