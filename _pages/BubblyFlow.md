# Bubbly Flow: Vortexâ€“Bubble Interactions and Drag Reduction

## Overview

My doctoral research at IISc Bangalore focused on understanding **bubbly turbulent flows**, examining the complex interactions between air bubbles, buoyant rigid particles, and vortex structures, alongside applications in drag reduction. This work builds fundamental insights for marine, industrial, and environmental multiphase flows.

## ðŸŒ€ **Part I: Vortex Ring and Bubble Interaction**

**Project Title:** Effects of bubble size on vorticity dynamics and bubble dynamics

Most studies on bubble deformation or breakup in turbulence do not isolate bubble size effects. In this project:

- **Objective:** Understand two-way interactions between a vortex ring and a deforming bubble at different bubble-to-vortex ring size ratios (Î¦) across a wide range of Weber numbers (We).
- **Key Findings:**
  - Bubble deformation and breakup dynamics vary significantly with Î¦, even at fixed We, during initial interactions.
  - Later stages showed dynamics governed primarily by We alone.
  - Vortex ring propagation speed and enstrophy reductions followed a scaling of Î¦Â²/âˆšWe.
  - A critical Î¦ â‰ˆ 1.2 was identified, above which dramatic vortex deformation and core fragmentation occur.

## âš« **Part II: Rigid Buoyant Particle and Vortex Ring Interaction**

**Project Title:** The role of deformability in vortexâ€“particle interactions

To understand bubble deformability effects:

- **Objective:** Compare interactions of a vortex ring with a rigid buoyant particle (non-deforming bubble) versus deformable bubbles.
- **Key Findings:**
  - Rigid particles showed longer capture times due to higher drag, unlike quickly elongating bubbles.
  - Particles stayed localized within the ring core, while bubbles spread azimuthally.
  - Rigid particles induced larger localized vorticity perturbations, leading to greater reductions in vortex propagation speed and enstrophy compared to bubbles.

## ðŸ«§ **Part III: Vortex Ring and Bubble Swarm Interaction**

**Project Title:** Effect of single and multiple bubbles on a thin vortex ring

- **Objective:** Study vortex ring interactions with multiple bubbles to understand bubbly turbulent flow analogues.
- **Key Findings:**
  - Vortex rings continuously capture bubbles from swarms, rapidly increasing the volume ratio of bubbles within the ring.
  - This results in a more dramatic and faster decay of the vortex ring compared to single-bubble interactions.

## ðŸ’§ **Part IV: Bubble Drag Reduction in Turbulent Channel Flow**

**Project Title:** Effects of salt concentration on wall bubble injection in turbulent channel flow: bubble dynamics and wall drag reduction

- **Objective:** Investigate effects of salt concentration (M) on bubble dynamics and drag modification in turbulent channel flows.
- **Key Findings:**
  - Increasing M reduced bubble coalescence, resulting in smaller bubbles with altered deformability, migration, and distribution.
  - At low Re, salt addition dramatically reduced bubble sizes (from ~cm to ~100 microns), increasing drag until a critical concentration (M_critical) was reached.
  - At higher Re, bubble dynamics became less sensitive to M, leading to smaller drag increases and lower M_critical values.
